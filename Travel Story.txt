You plan on travelling to Greece you and your wife dont know wether to get nice seats and a decent house or the opposite. She leaves it up to you and goes to pack. Which do you pick?

-> Expensive seats -> plane crashes & he only survives -> no money left goes to hostel -> finds a leprechaun's stash of gold in a pot
  -> takes the stash (& gets 1mil euros worth of gold)
    -> notify the authorities of the found money
    -> use it to buy a nice house (10 years later, random leprechaun shows up at his door and asks for his money back)
      -> tell the leprechaun to f off -> leprechaun takes nuke out of his pocket and nukes you
      -> tell the leprehaun that you spent alot of the money but will give him what you have left -> the leprechaun tells you that you can actually keep it but he needs his pot back.
  -> leaves it -> ends up life living as a hobo, eternally sad because of survivor's remorse and grieving dead wife.

-> Cheap seats but nice house -> Wife gets kidnapped
  -> Leave country without her without giving any f's (You continue your life, collecting the insurance money 7 years later and living a good live, never knowing wether she died or not...)
  -> Call up a gang of street fighters that owe you one and find your wife's captors -> wife turns out to have kidnapped herself because she's had enough of you
    -> ask her to come back home with you -> says no, stabs you & runs away. (You end up bleeding to death; your wife collects the insurance money, blaming your taxi driver for your murder, and lives the rest of her life happily with a new man.) 
    -> pull out your nunchucks (because you are secretly an undercover agent for the chinese) and fight her mortal combat style. (You end up fighting until you both pass out of exhaustion. You wake up but she's not there; she has left you enough money to make it out of the country, leaving no trace of her. You continue your life without her, regretting that you had not been able to stay togeter.)
